# Stylophone-1968
## Overview
This project provides several resources to document, recreate and enhance the original 1968 Dubreq Stylophone.

Note: There have been several versions of the original Stylophone ("New Sound") and a more modern recreation - this project is only for the original 1968 version.

Included in the project are:

* A modern KiCAD schematic for the original Stylophone
* Wiki-based Documentation on the functionality and design of the Stylophone
* Libre-Office spreadsheets demonstrating the maths within the design
* An OpenSCAD recreation of the Stylophone's case (modified for FFF 3D printing).

For more information about any of the above please see [the project wiki](https://github.com/simoninns/stylophone-1968/wiki)
